# Stock Valuation Models
## Intuition
- Traditional asset pricing models focus exclusively on understanding expected returns
	- Expected returns are not observed
- Even if expected returns could be observed, we would not be able to answer questions such as:
	- Is stock price too high?
## Intrinsic Value
- Intrinsic value of firm can help identify under-valued and over-valued securities by comparing intrinsic value (V) with market price that the stock is traded at (P)
	- P > V -> firm is over-valued: do not buy or sell if you own
	- P \< V -> firm is under-valued : buy or hold
	- P = V -> firm is fairly priced
## Dividend-Discount Model (DDM)

- Suppose we planned to hold a stock for 2 years
- Then we would recieve dividends in both year 1 and year two before selling the stock
