# CAPM
## Intuition
- CAPM, a well-used model to find the "fair" price of assets
	- Gives a precise prediction of the relationship that we should observe between the risk of an asset and its expected return
- There is a lot of variation
	- Core fundamental has remained the same: An investor is only rewarded for the systematic risk (not idiosyncratic risk)
## Understanding Beta
- Beta: A measure of undiversifiable risk
	- The beta for the overall market is 1.0
	- Stocks may have positive or negative betas, although nearly all investments have positive betas
		- Positive or negative sign in front of the beta number indicates whether the stock's return moves in same direction as general market or in the opposite direction

### Formula
Expected return on investment = Risk-free rate + Beta for investment * (Expected market return - Risk free rate)

## Measuring Beta for a Portfolio
- The portfolio beta: calculated as the weighted average of the betas of the individual assets in the portfolio
