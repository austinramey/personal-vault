Advised AGAINST options due to high risk nature
# Options: Puts and Calls
## Derivative Securities
- Derive value from the price behavior of an underlying asset
	- Owners of put and call options have no voting rites, no privileges of ownership, and no interest or dividend income
	- Options allow buyers to use leverage
		- Investors can benefit from stock-price movements without having to invest a lot of capital
## Call Options
- Bullish about underlying assets
- Confident in the stock that is underlying to the call
- Gives the holder the right to purchase an asset for a spec. price, called exercise/strike price, on or before specified date
- Purchase price of the options is called ==called premium==
- Holder of the call is not required to exercise it
	- Will exercise the options to buy only if the stock's share price exceeds strike price
## Put Options
- Bearish about underlying assets
- Not confident in the stock that is underlying
- Choose to sell at a specified exercise/strike price on or before expiration date
	- Choose to pay a ==put premium==, and sell a stock at the specified price at the end of the option

When I hear them, I want to think:
- If call, want price to increase
- If put, want price to decrease
## Buyer vs Seller of Options
### Buyer:
- Has the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a fixed price for a time
- To acquire this right, option buyer must pay the option seller a fee known as the option premium
- Buyers do not have to exercise their options, they can walk away if there is no exercising the option
### Seller (or Writer):
- Recieves the option premium from the buyer up front
- Has the obligation to sell or buy the underlying assett according to the terms of the option contract
- This obligation is binding
## Options Expiration Date
- American Options: allows investors to exercise their right to buy or sell underlying asset on or before expiration date
	- All exchange-listed options in the US are American options
- European options: only permit investors to exercise on the expiration date
## Options Pricing
- In the money
	- Call option: when strike price is less than the market price of the underlying security
	- Put option: when strike price is greater than the market price of hte underlying asset
	- When an option is in the money, it's intrinisc value is greater than zero
- Out of the money
	- Call option: when strike price is greater than market price of the underlying securitiy
	- Put option:When the strike price is less than the market priceof the underlying security
- At the money: strike price = market price for both
## Trading Options
- Naked options: writer does not own the optioned securities, no limit on loss exposure
- Cover options: writer owns the optioned securities, loss exposure is limited to the price originally paid
- Option straddle: Simultaneous purchase of both a put and a call on the same stock
## Intrinsic Value
- Relationship between an options strike price and the underlying stock's market price
Intrinsic value = (Stock price - strike price) x 100 or 0, whichever is greater

# Examples
## Example 1
- Starts at 150
- Ends at 152
- Premium of 4.10
## Example 2
- Put option
- Start at 150
- Ends at 141
- Selling for 5.91
- Profit = 150 - 141 - 5.91 = 3.09
- HPR = profit / cost = 3.09 / 5.91 = 52.28%
- HPR means we get 52.28% in this placement
- Otherwise, HPR = 151-141/141 = 6% < 52.28%
