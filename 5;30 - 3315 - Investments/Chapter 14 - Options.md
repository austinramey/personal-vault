Advised AGAINST options due to high risk nature
# Options: Puts and Calls
## Derivative Securities
- Derive value from the price behavior of an underlying asset
	- Owners of put and call options have no voting rites, no privileges of ownership, and no interest or dividend income
	- Options allow buyers to use leverage
		- Investors can benefit from stock-price movements without having to invest a lot of capital
## Call Options
- Bullish about underlying assets
- Confident in the stock that is underlying to the call
- Gives the holder the right to purchase an asset for a spec. price, called exercise/strike price, on or before specified date
- Purchase price of the options is called ==called premium==
- Holder of the call is not required to exercise it
	- Will exercise the options to buy only if the stock's share price exceeds strike price
## Put Options
- Bearish about underlying assets
- Not confident in the stock that is underlying
- Choose to sell at a specified exercise/strike price on or before expiration date
	- Choose to pay a ==put premium==, and sell a stock at the specified price at the end of the option

When I hear them, I want to think:
- If call, want price to increase
- If put, want price to decrease
## Buyer vs Seller of Options
### Buyer:
- Has the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a fixed price for a time
- To acquire this right, option buyer must pay the option seller a fee known as the option premium
- Buyers do not have to exercise their options, they can walk away if there is no exercising the option
### Seller (or Writer):
- Recieves the option premium from the buyer up front
- Has the obligation to sell or buy the underlying assett according to the terms of the option contract
- This obligation is binding
# Examples
## Example 1
- Starts at 150
- Ends at 152
- Premium of 4.10
## Example 2
- Put option
- Start at 150
- Ends at 141
- Selling for 5.91
- Profit = 150 - 141 - 5.91 = 3.09
