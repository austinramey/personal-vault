# CAPM
## Intuition
- CAPM is a well-used model to find the "**fair**" price of assets
	- CAPM gives us a precise prediciton of the __relationship__ that we should observe between the __risk of an asset__ and its __expected return__
- There is a lot of variation but the idea stays the same, investor is only rewarded for the systematic risk (and not idiosyncratic risk)
## Understanding Beta
- Beta: Measure of __undiversifiable risk__
	- Beta for overall market is 1.0
	- Stocks may have +/- betas, although most have a postivie beta
		- This means that most investments follow the stock market
## Formula

Expectedreturn=Risk-free rate + Beta for investment * (Expected mkt return - Risk-free rate)

## Measuring Beta for a Portfolio

## Alpha
- We use SML relation as a benchmark to assess the fair expected return on a risky asset
	- In equilibrium, __all assets must lie on the SML__
	- With SML as benchmark, we can calculate expected return using historical prices and find a diferent expected return
- (alpha) = Actual average reutrn of security - Expected reutnr predicted by CAPM

## Advantageous and Limitations
- Pracitcal Appeal
- Limitations

# Security Market Line
- SML: graphically shows the expected return for any security given its beta
	- For __each level__ of undiversifiable risk, the SML shows the __return__ the investor should expect to earn in the marketplace
	- It is a picture of the CAPM
