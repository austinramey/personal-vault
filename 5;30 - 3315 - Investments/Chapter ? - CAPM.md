# CAPM
## Intuition
- CAPM is a well-used model to find the "**fair**" price of assets
	- CAPM gives us a precise prediciton of the __relationship__ that we should observe between the __risk of an asset__ and its __expected return__
- There is a lot of variation but the idea stays the same, investor is only rewarded for the systematic risk (and not idiosyncratic risk)
## Understanding Beta
- Beta: Measure of __undiversifiable risk__
	- Beta for overall market is 1.0
	- Stocks may have +/- betas, although most have a postivie beta
		- This means that most investments follow the stock market
## Formula

Expectedreturn=Risk-free rate + Beta for investment * (Expected mkt return - Risk-free rate)
