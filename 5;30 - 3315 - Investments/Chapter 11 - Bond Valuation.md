# Behavior of Market Interest Rates
- Bond market is not a single market, but consists of many different sectors
	- US Treasury Issues
	- Municipal bond issues
	- Corporate bond issues
- There is not single interest rate that applies to all the segments of the bond market
- ==Yield spreads==: differences in interest rates between various market sectors
# What Causes Interest Rates to Move
1. Inflation rate:
	- When investors expect inflation to slow down, interest rates generally fall as well
2. Changes in the money supply
	- Increase in money supply pushes rates down
3. Federal budget deficit
	- When US treasury has to borrow to cover deficit, increased demand for funds exerts upward pressure on interest rates
4. Level of economic activitiy
	- Businesses need more capital when economy expands
5. Policies of the federal reserve
	- Actions of the Federal Reserve to control inflation
6. Level of interest rates in major foreign markets

# Term Structure and Yield curve
- Bonds having different maturities typically have different interest rates
- Term strucutrue of interest rates
	- Relationship between interest rates and time to maturitiy for any class of similar-risk securities
- Yield curve: graph that depicts this relationship
# Why Yield Curve Shape Changes
## Expectations Hypothesis
- Investors will ask for a higher price if interst rate is expected to go up, since stock prices will go down
- 
## Liquidity Preference Theory
- Investors associate longer term with higher risk, and ask for a higher payout
## Market Segmentation Theory
- Bond market is segmented on the basis of the maturity preferences of different investors
# Pricing of Bonds
## Concept
- Bondholders receive two distinct types of cash flow
	- Periodic interest income
	- Principal at maturity
- Bonds are priced according to the present value of their future cash flow streams
Bond price = Present value of coupon payments + Present value of bond's par value
BP = SUM((CPN / (1 + r)^t) + (FV/(1+r)^N))
FV = Face Value
# Yield to Maturity
- Most important and widely used measure of a bond's return
	- Also known as promised yield
	- Rate of return earned by an investor who holds a bond to maturity and receives all principal and interest payments when promised
	- Used not only to gauge return on a single issue, but also to measure required returns for bread classes on bonds
	- Basically, internal rate of return on a bond
YTM = (FV / PV) ^(1/N) - 1
## Example 3
- 15-year, zero coupon bond
- Price = 315
- If held to maturity, what is YTM?
= 
## Example 4
- YTM?
- Rate = 7.5%
- $1000 Par value
- 15 years to maturity
- Currently $809.50 in market
