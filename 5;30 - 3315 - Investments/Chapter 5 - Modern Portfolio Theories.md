# Principles of Portfolio Planning
## Portfolio Objectives
- Goal is an **efficient** portfolio
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Efficient portfolio</mark>: one that provides highest return for a given risk level
	- Requires search for investment alternatives to get best combination of <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">risk and return</mark>
What does it mean to have a negative wealth proportion?
# What is a Portfolio?
- Portfolio: A collection of investments assembled to meet one or more investment goals
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Growth-oriented</mark>: Primary goal is long-term price appreciation
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Income-oriented</mark>: designed to produce regular dividends and interest
# Return of a Portfolio

# Risk of a Portfolio
- To quantify a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">single asset</mark> risk, we measure its stnd dev.
- When combined in a portfolio, risk is affected by
	- Standard deviation of each asset within the portfolio
	- Weight of each asset
	- Correlation between each asset in the portfolio
## Measuring Assets Co-Movement
Covariance and Correlation: Review of two stat concepts
- Covariance: Measure if two returns move together or opposite to one another

- Correlation: Normalized covariance to measure that covar. lies between -1 and 1

	- Positively correlated: two series tend to move in same direction
	- Negatively correlated: two series tend to move in opposite directions
	- Uncorrelated: two series bear no relationship to each other
# Diversification
## Portfolio's Source of Risk
Systematic vs Idiosyncratic Risk
- Total risk can be broken down into
	1. Systematic/market/non-diversifiable risk
	2. Idiosyncratic/firm-specific/diversifiable risk
- Diversification should reduce idiosyncratic risk
	- We want to elim. idio. risk because the reward for holding risky assets depends on systematic risk
## Concept of Diversification
- The lower the correlation, the greater the risk reduction that investors can achieve by combining those assets in a portfolio
	- When corr. = 1, portfolios merely average the risk of the assets
	- When corr < 1, portfolio's risk will be less than average
	- When corr = -1, there will be some comb. of the assets that produce a portfolio with no risk at all
