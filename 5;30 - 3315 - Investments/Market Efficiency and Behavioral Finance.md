# Market Efficiency
## Random Walk Hypothesis
- Theory that stock price movements are largely unpredictable
	- Studies of stock price movements indicate that they do not move in predictable patterns
	- This random pattern is a natural outcome of markets that are efficient and respond quickly to new info
## Definition
- Efficient market: market that rapidly and fully incorporates new info
	- Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH): stock prices rapidly incorporate new info
		- Investors should not expect to consistently earn abnormal returns
		- EMH implies that consistently higher expected returns require more risk
## Implications
If the EMH is true and market and efficient then
- Markets are efficient
- Investors can only expect higher returns with more risk
- Prices are not predictable over time
- Actual returns will be higher or lower than expected returns, due to luck
- Abnormal returns are unpredictable
- An investor can still earn high abnormal returns
- Passive investing is a good strategy
- A type of mutual fund with appeal to this is an index fund

If the EMH is NOT true and markets are inefficient, then
- Everything is flipped
- Abnormal returns are predictable
- Investor can earn high abnormal returns
- Investor can earn consistently high returns without more risk
## Levels of EMH
1. Weak form
	- Past data on stock prices are of no use in predicting future stock price changes
	- Stock prices move at random
2. Semi-strong form
	- Investors cannot consistently earn abnormally high returns using publicly available info
	- Any price anomalies are quickly discovered and market adjusts
3. Strong form
	- There is no info, public or private, that allows investors to consistently earn abnormally high returns
## Arbitrage and Efficient Markets
==Arbitrage==: type of transaction in which an investor simultaneously buys and sells the same asset at different prices to earn an instant, risk-free profit
- Also known as the process that quickly eliminates price discrepancies in efficient markets is know as
- In the "real world" if price differences exist, arbitragers exploit those differences and through their buying and selling transactions push the prices closer together until no arbitrage opportunity remains
# Market Anomalies
## Calendar effects
Stock returns may be closely tied to the time of the year or time of the week
- Ex: January effect, where small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap stocks by a wide margin
## Small-firm Effect (Size Effect)
- Small firms tend to earn positive abnormal returns as much as 5% to 6% per year
- Small firm may offer higher returns than larger firms, even after adjusting for risk
## Post Earnings Announcement Drift
- Stock price adjustments may continue after earnings adjustments have been announced
- This pattern seems to create an opportunity for investors to earn abnormal returns by purchasing stocks that have recently issued good earnings news, or short selling if poor earnings
## Momentum
- Tendency for stocks that have gone up recently to keep going up, or vice versa for down
## Value Effect
- Uses P/E or market-to-book ratios to buy or sell stocks
- On average, low P/E or market-to-book ratio stocks outperform high P/E or market-to-book ratio stocks
