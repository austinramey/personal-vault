# Market Efficiency
## Random Walk Hypothesis
- Theory that stock price movements are largely unpredictable
	- Studies of stock price movements indicate that they do not move in predictable patterns
	- This random pattern is a natural outcome of markets that are efficient and respond quickly to new info
## Definition
- Efficient market: market that rapidly and fully incorporates new info
	- Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH): stock prices rapidly incorporate new info
		- Investors should not expect to consistently earn abnormal returns
		- EMH implies that consistently higher expected returns require more risk
## Implications
If the EMH is true and market and efficient then
- Markets are efficient
- Investors can only expect higher returns with more risk
- Prices are not predictable over time
- Actual returns will be higher or lower than expected returns, due to luck
- Abnormal returns are unpredictable
- An investor can still earn high abnormal returns
- Passive investing is a good strategy
- A type of mutual fund with appeal to this is an index fund

If the EMH is NOT true and markets are inefficient, then
- Everything is flipped
- Abnormal returns are predictable
- Investor can earn high abnormal returns
- Investor can earn consistently high returns without more risk
## Levels of EMH
1. Weak form
	- Past data on stock prices are of no use in predicting future stock price changes
	- Stock prices move at random
2. Semi-strong form
	- Investors cannot consistently earn abnormally high returns using publicly available info
	- Any price anomalies are quickly discovered and market adjusts
3. Strong form
	- There is no info, public or private, that allows investors to consistently earn abnormally high returns
## Arbitrage and Efficient Markets
==Arbitrage==: type of transaction in which an investor simultaneously buys and sells the same asset at different prices to earn an instant, risk-free profit
- Also known as the process that quickly eliminates price discrepancies in efficient markets is know as
- In the "real world" if price differences exist, arbitragers exploit those differences and through their buying and selling transactions push the prices closer together until no arbitrage opportunity remains
# Market Anomalies
## Calendar effects
Stock returns may be closely tied to the time of the year or time of the week
- Ex: January effect, where small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap stocks by a wide margin
## Small-firm Effect (Size Effect)
- Small firms tend to earn positive abnormal returns as much as 5% to 6% per year
- Small firm may offer higher returns than larger firms, even after adjusting for risk
## Post Earnings Announcement Drift
- Stock price adjustments may continue after earnings adjustments have been announced
- This pattern seems to create an opportunity for investors to earn abnormal returns by purchasing stocks that have recently issued good earnings news, or short selling if poor earnings
## Momentum
- Tendency for stocks that have gone up recently to keep going up, or vice versa for down
## Value Effect
- Uses P/E or market-to-book ratios to buy or sell stocks
- On average, low P/E or market-to-book ratio stocks outperform high P/E or market-to-book ratio stocks
# Behavioral finance
## Challenge to EMH
Market participants make systematic mistakes when they invest
- These patterns in behavior could lead to predictable patterns in prices and returns
## Investor Behavior and Security Prices
1. Overconfidence: Investors tend to be overconfident in their judgement or ability and this leads them to underestimate risks
2. Self-attribution bias: Investors tend to take credit for successes and blame factors out of their control for failures
3. Loss aversion: tendency to exhibit risk-averse behavior when confronting gains and risk-seeking behavior when confronting losses
4. Representativeness: cognitive biases that occur because people have difficulty thinking about randomness in outcomes
5. Overreaction: Investors overreact to a string of good performance and overestimate the likelihood that the trend will continue
6. Narrow framing: investors tend to analyze in isolation
7. Belief perseverance: Investors ignore info that conflicts with their existing beliefs
8. Anchoring: Individuals attempting to predict or estimate some unknown quantity too much weight on information that they have at hand, even when that info is not particularly relevant
9. Familiarity bias: Investors buy stocks that are familiar to them without regard to whether the stocks are good buys or not
# Technical Analysis
## Measuring the Market
### Confidence index:
a measure that attempts to capture the tone of the market through bond returns
- Ratio that reflects the spread between average yield on high-grade corporate bonds relative to yield on average
- Ratio between average yield on corporate bonds relative to yield on average
Confidence interval = 
Average yield on 10 high-grade corporate bonds / 
average yield on 10 intermediate-grade bonds
- Grading: based on how safe they are, they get a better score

### Market Volume
- Amount of investors interest in the stock market
- Increasing volume during a rising market is a positive sign that the upward movement in stocks
	- Increasing value -> advances
	- Decreasing value -> declines
- When stocks have been moving up and volume begins to drop off, they signal end of a bull market
- Easy statistic to track as it is reported by numerous sources
### Breadth of Market
- Looks at number of stocks that go up versus number of stock prices that go down
- Number of advances and declines reflects underlying sentiment of investors
	- Market is strong when advances outnumber declines
	- Market is weak when declines outnumber advances
- Data on advances and declines are widely available
### Advance-Decline Line
- Advance-decline line is just difference between these two numbers
- Each day's net number is added/subtracted from running total and results are plotted on a graph
	- If rising, advancing is dominating declining and tech analysts conclude market is strong
### New Highs-New Lows
- Measure difference between stocks reaching a 52-week high and stocks reaching a 52-week low
	- A 10-day moving average is plotted on a graph to view trends
- Used as a signal to buy or sell stocks
	- Market is strong when highs/lows
	- Market is weak when lows/highs
#### Example 1
- July = 47-20 = 27
- August = 54-24 = 30
- September = 33
- October = 38
- November = 46
- December = 58
- Despite small drop in sep. and october, it is increasing, so it is a bullish market
### Short Interest
Number of shares of stocks sold short in the market at any point in time
- More shares that are sold short, the higher the short interest
- Can give two different interpretations
	- Future demand for stock and present market optimism/pessimism
### Odd-lot Trading
Many small traders deal in transactions of fewer than 100 shares, or odd-lots
### Theory of contrary opinion
Uses amount and type of odd-lot trading as an indicator of current state of the market and pending changes
- Assumes that small traders will do just the opposite of what should be done:
	- Panic and sell when market is low
	- Speculate and buy when market is high
-
