# Market Efficiency
## Random Walk Hypothesis
- Theory that stock price movements are largely unpredictable
	- Studies of stock price movements indicate that they do not move in predictable patterns
	- This random pattern is a natural outcome of markets that are efficient and respond quickly to new info
## Definition
- Efficient market: market that rapidly and fully incorporates new info
	- Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH): stock prices rapidly incorporate new info
		- Investors should not expect to consistently earn abnormal returns
		- EMH implies that consistently higher expected returns require more risk
## Implications
If the EMH is true and market and efficient then
- Markets are efficient
- Investors can only expect higher returns with more risk
- Prices are not predictable over time
- Actual returns will be higher or lower than expected returns, due to luck
- Abnormal returns are unpredictable
- An investor can still earn high abnormal returns
- Passive investing is a good strategy
- A type of mutual fund with appeal to this is an index fund

If the EMH is NOT true and markets are inefficient, then
- Everything is flipped
- Abnormal returns are predictable
- Investor can earn high abnormal returns
- Investor can earn consistently high returns without more risk
## Levels of EMH
1. Weak form
	- Past data on stock prices are of no use in predicting future stock price changes
	- Stock prices move at random
2. Semi-strong form
	- Investors cannot consistently earn abnormally high returns using publicly available info
	- Any price anomalies are quickly discovered and market adjusts
3. Strong form
	- There is no info, public or private, that allows investors to consistently earn abnormally high returns
## Arbitrage and Efficient Markets
==Arbitrage==: type of transaction in which an investor simultaneously buys and sells the same asset at different prices to earn an instant, risk-free profit
- Also known as the process that quickly eliminates price
