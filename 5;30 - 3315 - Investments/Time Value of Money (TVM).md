# Concept
- $1 today is worth more than the promise of $1 in one year's time
- Why?
	1. Time
		- Most people prefer to spend today rather than waiting to spend
	1. Risk
		- Uncertainty of receiving the promised cash one year form now
## Important Rule
- To compare cash flows at <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">different dates</mark>, we must <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">convert them</mark> to the same date
- We can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">move cash flows</mark> over time using <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">interest rates</mark>
# Moving Cash in time
- Given an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">interest rate r</mark>
	- We <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">compound</mark> to move <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">forward</mark>
	- We <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">discount</mark> to move <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">backwards</mark>
## Compounding: Finding Future Value (FV)
- FV(C,r,N) = C(1+r)^N
- FV = future value
- C = payment
- r = Interest rate
- N = # of periods
## Discounting: Finding PV
- PV(C,r,N) = C/(1+r)^N
- PV = present value
# Special Cases
- Each require:
	- The same payment each period
	- The same interest and same growth rate each period
## Perpetuity
$$
PV = C/(1+r)^1 + C/(1+r)^2 + C/(1+r)^3 + K
$$

## Example
- A share of stock will pay a $3 dividend after one year, and after that dividends will grow at 5% for another 4 years.
- From that point onwards, dividends will grow at 2% per year forever.
- If the interest rate is 10%, what is the value of the share?
