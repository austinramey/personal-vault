# Bonds
Publicly traded, long-term debt securities
- Issuer agrees to pay a fixed amount of interest periodically and to repay a fixed amount at maturity
	- Bondholders are lenders, not owners (like stocks)
	- Bond issuers are borrowers
- Like stocks, bonds can provide both current income and capital gains
Behavior of interest rates is the most imporntant influence on bond returns
- When interest rates ==rise==, bond ==prices fall==
	- When interst rates are rising, total returns on bonds include capital losses that can sometimes exceed bonds' interest income, resulting in a negative total return
- When interest rates ==drop==, bond prices ==move up==
## Corporate vs Govt. Bonds
Corporate and govt. bond rates tend to move together, but coprorate bond yields are higher
- Corporate bonds are ==riskier== and thus require a higher rate to compensate for this risk
- ==Difference== between corporate and govt bond rates is called ==yield/credit spread==
- 
## Bonds vs Stocks
- Compared with stocks, bonds offer lower returns
- Main benefits of bonds in a portfolio
	- Lower risk
	- High levels of current income
	- Diversification
- Bonds add an element of stability to a portfolio
## Major Source of Risk for Bonds
1. Interest rate risk: interest rates will bring down value
2. Purchasing power risk: chance that the yield is below inflation
3. Business/Financial Risk: issuer cannot meet obligation
4. Liquidity Risk: bond cannot be sold at a reasonable price
5. Call Risk: bond will be "called" before it's scheduled maturity risk
## Feature of a Bond
- Coupon: amount of annual interst income that it pays to bondholder
	- Payments = coupon rate x face value
		- Face value is 1000 in this class
- Principal: amount that the borrower must repay at maturity; also called par/face value
- Coupon rate: coupon divided by the bond's par value and it simply expresses interst payment of par value
	- Current yield: measures the interst component of a bond's return relative to the bond's market price
		- current yield = coupon payment / p0
### Example 1
- 6% bond with 1000 par value, priced at 950 current
- What is current yield?
- payment = 6% * 1000 = 60
- yield = 60/950 = 
### Example 2
- Current yield = 5.3% market price 1100
- payment = 1000 * 5.3% = 58.3
- rate = 58.3/1100 =
