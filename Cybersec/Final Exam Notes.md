- What is Cryptography?
	- Unencrypted info - Information in an understandable form. Typically called <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">cleartext</mark> or <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">cleartext</mark>
	- Encrypted info - Info in a scrambled form. Typically called <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">ciphertext</mark>
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Decryption</mark> is the act of unscrambling ciphertext into plaintext
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Algorithm</mark>: the mathematical process for which encryption and decryption happens
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Cipher</mark>: algorithm to encrypt or decrypt info
- Algorithms without only an encryption step are called <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">one-way algorithms</mark>. The output of which is called a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">hash</mark>.
- Every cipher and any plaintext you want to encrypt needs a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">key</mark>
- Broken into two categories:
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Public</mark>: use the same key to encrypt and decrypt
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Public</mark> (asymmetric): use different keys to encrypt and decrypt
- The number of possible keys to a cipher is a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">keyspace</mark>
- Ways that this helps with cybersecurity concepts
	- Confidentiality: allows data to be kept safe from criminals
	- Integrity: can use <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">checksums</mark> to ensure that the same data is always sent back and forth
	- Authentication: checks identity of both sender and receiver and ensures that only the intended recipients receive the message
