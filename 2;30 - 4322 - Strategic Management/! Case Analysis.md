Lastly, list the importance of each unit to Johnson & Johnson according to the numbers provided in the case

As the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, Johnson & Johnson, the world’s largest health care company, was quick to join the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed. It was able to secure $456 million in funds to develop a vaccine for COVID and later received another $1 billion for the manufacture and delivery of 100 million doses if it received approval.1 Although J&J lagged behind rivals, it was believed that its vaccine would prove to be more popular because it would require only one dose and be stable in normal refrigeration for up to a month. Among other things, this was expected to create a higher demand for its vaccine in many parts of the developing world. 

However, as the pandemic raged and coinciding side effects of each vaccine came to light, J&J’s vaccine came under fire with some relatively serious risks compared to its competitors. As of January 2022, the J&J booster shot was said to put recipients at risk for developing immune thrombocytopenia, a bleeding disorder targeting those with a low level of platelets. This came after the original one-and-done J&J vaccine came with risks for developing a blood clotting disease known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome.2 Although developing these disorders has been said to be rare, the CDC recommended using Moderna or Pfizer vaccines if available.

In response to this, new CEO Joaquin Duato said he planned on being active on the medical device acquisition market, stating that they “don’t have an artificial ceiling as far as deal size.” This and a projected $3.5 billion in sales with their vaccine will hopefully move them back to the top of the pharma food chain.3

J&J recently has been no stranger to drawbacks regarding its health care solutions. It has come under fire after news surfaced about settlements the firm paid for problems with its hip replacements and for problems with a children’s drug. The lawsuits tarnished the well-established reputation J&J developed over many years. The firm’s reputation derived from its diversified businesses ranging from pharmaceuticals to consumer products that have reflected its wide range of expertise and allowed it to develop a customer base that spans from consumers to hospitals to governments. The financial stability that resulted from its range of businesses has been J&J’s cornerstone for decades. Its sales have risen on a regular basis, although profits have dipped a bit in recent years (see Exhibits 1 and 2). The firm has raised its dividends for well over 50 years and it remains one of only two U.S. companies with an AAA credit rating from Standard and Poor’s. “They’re in a great position,” said Kristen Stewart, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. “They have the luxury of time and the ability to look at different opportunities across different business units. That is what a diversified business platform affords them.”

However, even as it has grown and become more diversified, J&J has struggled to find a way to manage its vast portfolio of diversified businesses. Much of its growth has come from acquisitions and it has developed a culture of granting considerable autonomy to each of the firms that it has absorbed. Although this was intended to cultivate an entrepreneurial attitude among each of its units, this has prevented J&J from instilling a strong set of controls, such as for quality standards. It has also prevented the firm from pursuing opportunities on which its various units could combine their different areas of expertise.

Former CEOs William Weldon and Alex Gorsky had pushed harder to weave together the operations of the different units. The need for greater oversight became more urgent after the firm ran into quality issues with some of its well-known products. But like Gorsky and Weldon before him, new CEO Joaquin Duato realized that J&J must try to find a balance between its new push for greater control and its traditional emphasis on autonomy throughout the organization.
   
                
# Cultivating Entrepreneurship
                
Johnson & Johnson was founded in 1886 by three brothers named Johnson. The company grew slowly for a generation before Robert Wood Johnson II decided reluctantly to take the family business public. He fretted about the effects that market pressures would have on the company’s practices and values, which led him to write a 307-word statement of corporate principles. This spelled out that J&J’s primary responsibility was to patients and physicians, followed by employees, and then by communities. Shareholders were placed last on the list. This credo is inscribed in stone at the entrance of the firm’s headquarters and is still routinely invoked around the company.

Over the years, as J&J has grown by acquisitions of firms engaged in some aspect of health care, it has been guided by its credo. The task has become more challenging as J&J has developed into an astonishingly complex enterprise, made up of over 260 different subsidiaries that have been broken down into three different divisions. The most widely known of these is the division that makes consumer products such as Johnson & Johnson baby care products, Band-Aid adhesive strips, and Visine eye drops. Its pharmaceuticals division sells several blockbuster drugs such as anemia drug Procrit and schizophrenia drug Risperdal. Its medical devices division is responsible for best-selling products such as Depuy orthopedic joint replacements and Cypher coronary stents.

In particular, J&J’s credo has kept the firm focused on health care, even as it has expanded into several different business segments. Furthermore, it has pushed the company to adopt a decentralized approach in managing its different businesses. Most of its far-flung subsidiaries across its three divisions were acquired because of the potential demonstrated by some promising new products in its pipeline. Each of these units was therefore granted near-total autonomy to develop and expand upon their best-selling products in order to better serve their patients (see Exhibit 3).

It is widely believed that this independence has fostered an entrepreneurial attitude that has kept J&J intensely competitive as others around it have faltered. The relative autonomy that is accorded to the business units has also provided the firm with the ability to respond swiftly to emerging opportunities. A strong enough commitment from everyone throughout these units to the principles that have been laid out in the credo were considered to be sufficient to provide the necessary direction.

J&J has actually been quite proud of the considerable freedom it has given to its different subsidiaries in order to develop and execute their own strategies. Besides developing their strategies, these units have also been allowed to work with their own resources. Many of them have even been able to operate their own finance and human resources departments. While this degree of decentralization has led to relatively high overhead costs, none of the executives that have run J&J (Weldon included) had ever thought that this was too high a price to pay. “J&J is a huge company, but you didn’t feel like you were in a big company,” recalled a scientist who used to work there.

## Pushing for More Collaboration
The entrepreneurial culture that Johnson & Johnson developed over the years has clearly allowed it to show a consistent level of high performance. Indeed, J&J has top-notch products in each of the areas in which it operates. It has been spending heavily on research and development for many years, taking its position among the world’s top spenders (see Exhibit 4). It has been spending about 12 percent of its sales on about 9,000 scientists working in research laboratories around the world. This allows each of the three divisions to continually introduce promising new products.

In spite of the benefits that J&J has derived from giving its various enterprises considerable autonomy, there have been growing concerns that they can no longer be allowed to operate in near isolation. Shortly after Weldon had taken charge of the firm, he realized that J&J was in a strong position to exploit new opportunities by drawing on the diverse skills of its various subsidiaries across the three divisions. In particular, he was aware that his firm may be able to derive more benefits from the combination of its knowledge in drugs, devices, and diagnostics, since few companies were able to match its reach and strength in these basic areas.

This had led former CEO Weldon to find ways to make its fiercely independent units work together. In his own words: “There is a convergence that will allow us to do things we haven’t done before.”6 Through pushing the various far-flung units of the firm to pool their resources, Weldon believed the firm could become one of the few that may actually be able to attain that often-promised, rarely delivered idea of synergy. In order to pursue this, he created a corporate office that would get business units to work together on promising new opportunities. “It’s a recognition that there’s a way to treat disease that’s not in silos,” Weldon stated, referring to the need for collaboration between J&J’s largely independent businesses.7
For the most part, however, Weldon confined himself to taking steps to foster better communication and more frequent collaboration among J&J’s disparate operations. He was convinced that such a push for communication and coordination would allow the firm to develop the synergy he was seeking. But Weldon was also aware that any effort to get the different business units to collaborate must not quash the entrepreneurial spirit that had spearheaded most of the growth of the firm to date. Jerry Caccott, managing director of consulting firm Strategic Decisions Group, emphasized that cultivating those alliances “would be challenging in any organization, but particularly in an organization that has been so successful because of its decentralized culture.”

These collaborative efforts did lead to the introduction of some highly successful products (see Exhibit 5). Even the company’s fabled consumer brands have started to show growth as a result of increased collaboration between the consumer products and pharmaceutical divisions. Its new liquid Band-Aid is based on a material used in a wound-closing product sold by one of J&J’s hospital-supply businesses. And J&J has used its prescription antifungal treatment, Nizoral, to develop a dandruff shampoo. In fact, products that have developed in large part out of such a form of cross-fertilization have allowed the firm’s consumer business to experience considerable internal growth.
