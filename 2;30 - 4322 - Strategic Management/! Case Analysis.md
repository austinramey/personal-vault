# Case Text
## Header 1
As the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, Johnson & Johnson, the world’s largest health care company, was quick to join the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed. It was able to secure $456 million in funds to develop a vaccine for COVID and later received another $1 billion for the manufacture and delivery of 100 million doses if it received approval.1 Although J&J lagged behind rivals, it was believed that its vaccine would prove to be more popular because it would require only one dose and be stable in normal refrigeration for up to a month. Among other things, this was expected to create a higher demand for its vaccine in many parts of the developing world. 

However, as the pandemic raged and coinciding side effects of each vaccine came to light, J&J’s vaccine came under fire with some relatively serious risks compared to its competitors. As of January 2022, the J&J booster shot was said to put recipients at risk for developing immune thrombocytopenia, a bleeding disorder targeting those with a low level of platelets. This came after the original one-and-done J&J vaccine came with risks for developing a blood clotting disease known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome.2 Although developing these disorders has been said to be rare, the CDC recommended using Moderna or Pfizer vaccines if available.

In response to this, new CEO Joaquin Duato said he ==planned on being active on the medical device acquisition market==, stating that they “don’t have an artificial ceiling as far as deal size.” ==This== and a ==projected $3.5 billion in sales with their vaccine== will hopefully move them back to the ==top of the pharma food chain==.3

J&J recently has been no stranger to drawbacks regarding its health care solutions. It has come under fire after news surfaced about settlements the firm paid for problems with its hip replacements and for problems with a children’s drug. The lawsuits tarnished the well-established reputation J&J developed over many years. The firm’s reputation derived from its diversified businesses ranging from pharmaceuticals to consumer products that have reflected its wide range of expertise and allowed it to develop a customer base that spans from consumers to hospitals to governments. The financial stability that resulted from its range of businesses has been J&J’s cornerstone for decades. Its sales have risen on a regular basis, although profits have dipped a bit in recent years (see Exhibits 1 and 2). The firm has raised its dividends for well over 50 years and it remains one of only two U.S. companies with an AAA credit rating from Standard and Poor’s. “They’re in a great position,” said Kristen Stewart, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. “They have the luxury of time and the ability to look at different opportunities across different business units. That is what a diversified business platform affords them.”

However, even as it has grown and become more diversified, J&J has struggled to find a way to manage its vast portfolio of diversified businesses. ==Much of its growth== has come from ==acquisitions== and it has ==developed a culture of granting considerable autonomy to each of the firms== that it has absorbed. Although this was ==intended to cultivate an entrepreneurial attitude== among each of its units, this has ==prevented J&J from instilling a strong set of controls==, such as for quality standards. It has also prevented the firm from pursuing opportunities on which its various units could combine their different areas of expertise.

Former CEOs William Weldon and Alex Gorsky had pushed harder to weave together the operations of the different units. The need for greater oversight became more urgent after the firm ran into quality issues with some of its well-known products. But like Gorsky and Weldon before him, new CEO Joaquin Duato realized that J&J must try to find a balance between its new push for greater control and its traditional emphasis on autonomy throughout the organization.
## Cultivating Entrepreneurship

Johnson & Johnson was founded in 1886 by three brothers named Johnson. The company grew slowly for a generation before Robert Wood Johnson II decided reluctantly to take the family business public. He fretted about the effects that market pressures would have on the company’s practices and values, which led him to write a 307-word statement of corporate principles. This spelled out that J&J’s ==primary responsibility== was to patients and physicians, ==followed by employees==, and ==then by communities==. ==Shareholders== were ==placed last== on the list. This credo is inscribed in stone at the entrance of the firm’s headquarters and is still routinely invoked around the company.

Over the years, as J&J has grown by acquisitions of firms engaged in some aspect of health care, it has been guided by its credo. The task has become more challenging as J&J has developed into an astonishingly complex enterprise, made up of ==over 260 different subsidiaries== that have been broken down into ==three different divisions==. The most widely known of these is the division that ==makes consumer products== such as Johnson & Johnson baby care products, Band-Aid adhesive strips, and Visine eye drops. Its ==pharmaceuticals division== sells several blockbuster drugs such as anemia drug Procrit and schizophrenia drug Risperdal. Its ==medical devices division== is responsible for best-selling products such as Depuy orthopedic joint replacements and Cypher coronary stents.

In particular, J&J’s credo has kept the firm ==focused on health care==, even as it has expanded into several different business segments. Furthermore, it has pushed the company to ==adopt a decentralized approach in managing== its different businesses. Most of its far-flung subsidiaries across its three divisions were acquired because of the potential demonstrated by some promising new products in its pipeline. Each of these units was therefore granted near-total autonomy to develop and expand upon their best-selling products in order to better serve their patients (see Exhibit 3).

![[screen-2024-09-27-18-58-52.png]]

It is widely believed that this ==independence== has ==fostered== an ==entrepreneurial attitude== that has kept J&J ==intensely competitive== as others around it have faltered. The ==relative autonomy== that is accorded to the business units has also ==provided the firm with the ability to respond swiftly== to emerging opportunities. A strong enough commitment from everyone throughout these units to the principles that have been laid out in the credo were considered to be sufficient to provide the necessary direction.

J&J has actually been quite proud of the considerable freedom it has given to its different subsidiaries in order to develop and execute their own strategies. Besides developing their strategies, these units have also been allowed to ==work with their own resources==. Many of them have even been able to operate their own finance and human resources departments. While this degree of decentralization has led to relatively high overhead costs, none of the executives that have run J&J (Weldon included) had ever thought that this was too high a price to pay. “J&J is a huge company, but you didn’t feel like you were in a big company,” recalled a scientist who used to work there.

## Pushing for More Collaboration
The entrepreneurial culture that Johnson & Johnson developed over the years has clearly allowed it to show a consistent level of high performance. Indeed, J&J has top-notch products in each of the areas in which it operates. It has been ==spending heavily on research and development== for many years, taking its position ==among the world’s top spenders== (see Exhibit 4). It has been spending about ==12 percent== of its sales on about 9,000 scientists working in research laboratories around the world. This allows each of the three divisions to continually introduce promising new products.

In spite of the benefits that J&J has derived from giving its various enterprises considerable autonomy, there have been growing concerns that they can no longer be allowed to operate in near isolation. Shortly after Weldon had taken charge of the firm, he realized that J&J was in a strong position to exploit new opportunities by drawing on the diverse skills of its various subsidiaries across the three divisions. In particular, he was aware that his firm may be able to derive more benefits from the combination of its knowledge in drugs, devices, and diagnostics, since few companies were able to match its reach and strength in these basic areas.

This had led former CEO Weldon to ==find ways== to make its fiercely ==independent units work together==. In his own words: “There is a convergence that will allow us to do things we haven’t done before.”6 Through pushing the various far-flung units of the firm to pool their resources, Weldon believed the firm could become one of the few that may actually be able to attain that often-promised, rarely delivered idea of synergy. In order to pursue this, he created a corporate office that would get business units to work together on promising new opportunities. “It’s a recognition that there’s a way to treat disease that’s not in silos,” Weldon stated, referring to the need for collaboration between J&J’s largely independent businesses.7

For the most part, however, Weldon confined himself to taking steps to ==foster better communication== and ==more frequent collaboration== among J&J’s disparate operations. He was convinced that such a push for communication and coordination would allow the firm to develop the synergy he was seeking. But Weldon was also aware that any effort to get the different business units to collaborate ==must not quash the entrepreneurial spirit== that had spearheaded most of the growth of the firm to date. Jerry Caccott, managing director of consulting firm Strategic Decisions Group, emphasized that cultivating those alliances “would be challenging in any organization, but particularly in an organization that has been so successful because of its decentralized culture.”

These collaborative efforts did lead to the introduction of some highly successful products (see Exhibit 5). Even the company’s fabled consumer brands have started to show growth as a result of increased collaboration between the consumer products and pharmaceutical divisions. Its new liquid Band-Aid is based on a material used in a wound-closing product sold by one of J&J’s hospital-supply businesses. And J&J has used its prescription antifungal treatment, Nizoral, to develop a dandruff shampoo. In fact, products that have developed in large part out of such a form of cross-fertilization have allowed the firm’s consumer business to experience considerable internal growth.

## Facing Quality Concerns
Even as Johnson & Johnson had been trying to get more involved with the efforts of its business units, it ran into ==problems with quality control== with two of its divisions. Its medical devices division had run into problems with its newest artificial hip. Although it did eventually recall the device, it was not before rumors had begun to circulate that company executives may have concealed information out of concern for firm profits. The problems with the medical devices unit were compounded by serious issues that arose with the consumer products unit, which led it to recall many of its products, including the biggest children’s drug recall of all time.

Quality problems had arisen before, but they were usually fixed on a regular basis. Analysts suggest that the problems at J&J’s McNeil division may have become exacerbated in 2006 when J&J decided to combine it with the newly acquired consumer health care unit from Pfizer. The firm believed that it could achieve $500 to $600 million in annual savings by merging the two units together. After the merger, McNeil was also transferred from the heavily regulated pharmaceutical division to the marketing-driven consumer products division, which was not subjected to the same level of quality control.

Much of the blame for J&J’s stumbles fell on William C. Weldon, who stepped down as CEO in April 2012 after presiding over one of the most tumultuous decades in the firm’s history. Critics said the company’s once vaunted attention to quality had slipped under his watch. Weldon, who had started out as a sales representative at the firm, was believed to have been obsessed with meeting tough performance targets, even by cutting costs that might affect quality. Erik Gordon, who teaches business at University of Michigan, elaborated on this philosophy: “We will make our numbers for the analysts, period.”9

In April 2012, J&J appointed Gorsky to lead the health care conglomerate out of the difficulties with quality that it had faced over the past few years. He had been with the firm since 1988, holding positions in its pharmaceutical businesses across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East before leaving for a few years to work at Novartis. Shortly after his return to J&J in 2008, he took over its medical devices unit that made the problematic hip implants. Since he took over, Gorsky has been ==dealing with the various lawsuits ==the firm faced over the problems with its hip replacements, paying out over $2.5 billion in settlements.10

Even as J&J was trying to get over its problems with the hip implants, there were rising concerns about the asbestos that might have contaminated its talcum powder-based products. Memos that were obtained during the court cases revealed that the firm may have known about this problem for years, but it tried to deny the charge and downplay any possible health threats from the use of their Baby Powder and other similar products.11 This ongoing problem with quality issues also forced Gorsky to find ways to gain more oversight over the firm’s 260-odd units. He wanted to push further than Weldon to work with the various units of the firm to establish standard practices that would allow the firm to pursue opportunities without posing risks to the firm’s long-established reputation.
## Pushing for Tighter Integration
In order to gain more oversight over all of its units, Gorsky lured Sandra Peterson from Bayer and gave her the position of group worldwide chairman. The newly created position gave Peterson ==sweeping responsibility== to ==oversee technology across the entire firm==. Gorsky believed that the very nature of the job required him to hire an outsider who had not had much exposure to J&J’s existing culture. Because decentralization had allowed each of the business units to make all of their own decisions, there had been no consistency in their different practices. Gorsky wanted to bring order to this unwieldly machine. “Sometimes a customer doesn’t want to deal with 250 J&J’s,” he said.

Peterson worked feverishly to align everything from HR policy to procurement processes from the 250 business units that had been making their own decisions independently. She covered everything from the timing of financial forecasts to employee car policies. She also consolidated all of the firm’s data from all of its 120,000 employees to a single HR database. Her efforts to process tons of data each day led to the creation of a warehouse, which contained upwards of 500 terabytes of data. By the time Peterson decided to leave J&J in October 2018, she claimed that her streamlining process would save the firm about $1 billion. Since Peterson’s departure, the company has been able to reconfigure her position by ==separating it based on product focus==. J&J now has 3 separate Worldwide Chairmen responsible for running the company’s 3 distinct product segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceuticals, and Medical Devices.

A far more significant effort had already been initiated by former global head of pharmaceuticals Paul Stoffels when he was appointed to the position a few years ago. All of the units that operated within the pharmaceutical division had also operated with complete autonomy. In particular, J&J’s seven different drug R&D organizations had operated in completely siloed fashion. In some cases, multiple companies pursued the development of the same drugs and each had its own system for handling clinical or regulatory development. Stoffels merged all of the units under his purview into one group and organized it to target 11 different diseases. In the process, 12 of the division’s 25 facilities were shuttered and nearly 200 projects were slashed.

This new integrated unit developed a streamlined development process, a highly coordinated system that Stoffels called Accererando. Under this model, global teams (statisticians in China, data managers in India, regulatory folks in Europe) ==work 24/7 to speed drugs to market==. The assembly-line approach has cut months and, in some cases, years off the development time. Its increase in drug approvals put J&J in a league of its own. “No other company has come close to that,” said Bernard Munos, a pharmaceutical innovation consultant.13

Stoffels had accomplished more than just reducing the time needed to bring drugs to market. He had begun to ==look for ideas from all sources==, whether from any of J&J’s own business units or from entrepreneurs or scientists outside the firm. He set up four innovation centers in biotech clusters (Cambridge, MA; Menlo Park, CA; London; and Shanghai) around the world, places where scientific entrepreneurs can interact with J&J’s own drug and technology scouts. His flexible approach with these outsiders lets J&J work with them more casually and helps build stronger relationships. Since 2013, the firm has reviewed more than 3,400 opportunities through these centers, leading to 200 partnerships.

After Stoffels announced his retirement at the end of 2021, new appointee Jennifer Taubert will look to continue his legacy and J&J’s mission helping relieve patients with a variety of issues such as cancer and mental illness.
## Is there a Cure Ahead?
Gorsky’s biggest challenge had come from a demand that Johnson & Johnson might be better off if it was broken off into smaller companies, perhaps along the lines of its different divisions. There were growing concerns about the ability of the conglomerate to provide sufficient supervision to all of its subsidiaries that were spread all over the globe. Gorsky dismissed this, claiming that J&J drew substantial benefits from the diversified nature of its businesses. Given the enormous shifts in the health care industry and the large number of government and institutional customers and partners involved, he believed that the firm’s huge scale could be a rare asset for negotiating deals.

In support of this belief, Gorsky pointed to J&J’s acquisition of Auris Health for approximately $3.4 billion in cash. The acquisition would accelerate the firm’s entry into surgical robotics and other interventional applications that have shown considerable potential for growth. “We believe the combination of best-in-class robotics, advanced instrumentation, and unparalleled end-to-end connectivity will make a meaningful difference in patient outcomes,” said Ashley McEvoy, executive vice president, who is in charge of J&J’s medical devices division.14 In another step, the firm has been working on an app in collaboration with Apple for its watch that can provide better data on cardiac issues.

Even as the now former CEO Gorsky plotted a course for the future of J&J, he was aware that its stock had been struggling recently because of some slower-growing segments of its business. He realized that it might not be possible to count on much growth from its existing model that granted considerable autonomy to each of its businesses. Above all, he had begun to feel strongly that he must provide more direction for these units, partly to encourage them to collaborate with each other in order to pursue emerging opportunities. He also understood that it is critical for J&J to take steps to develop sufficient controls that can minimize problems with quality control in the future.

However, it seems that J&J has once again run into trouble with a once-deemed prime opportunity for expansion. In late 2021 it was asserted that J&J made false claims and false promises during acquisition negotiations with Auris Health. J&J allegedly “misrepresented their intention for the robotic surgery” when they acquired Auris in 2019. The complaints cited the release of reserves related to payments within the agreement, as well as J&J’s promising autonomy and not granting autonomy post-merger.15 J&J has denied any and all misconduct.

As did much of the economy, J&J experienced pandemic slowdowns in 2020-2021, as well as a delay in a new MedTech production called Ottava. With their reputation continuing to decline, experts are starting to express their discontent with the health care giant’s future. “This is a company that was purer than Caesar’s wife, this was the gold standard, and all of a sudden it just seems like things are breaking down,” said William Trombetta, a professor of pharmaceutical marketing at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadephia.
