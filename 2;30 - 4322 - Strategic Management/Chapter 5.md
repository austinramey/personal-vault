## Three Generic Strategies
### Overall cost leadership

- Managing relationships throughout the entire value chain to lower costs
- Involves:
	- Aggressive construction of efficient scale facilities
	- Vigorous pursuit of cost reductions from experience
	- Tight cost and overhead control
	- Avoidance of marginal customer accounts
	- Cost minimization, such as AI, research and dev, service, etc.
### Differentiation

It requires:
- A level of cost parity relative to competitors
- Integration of multiple points along the value chain
	- Superior material handling operations to minimize damage
	- Low defect rates to improve quality
	- Accurate and responsive order processing
	- Personal relationships with key customers
	- Rapid response to customer service requests
Overall differentiation strategy
- Creates higher entry barriers due to customer loyalty

- Reduces buyer power because buyers lack suitable alternatives
- Establishes customer loyalty and less threat from substitutes
Pitfalls of Differentiation
- Unique does not mean valuable
- Too much differentiation
- Too high a price premium
- Differentiation that is easily imitated
- Dilution of brand identification through product line extensions
- Perceptions of differentiation may vary between buyers and sellers
### Focus
- Narrow product lines, buyer segments or targeted geographic markets
	- Advantages obtained through differentiation or cost leadership
