# Resource-Based View of a Firm
The RBV integrates two activities
1. Internal analysis of phenomena within a company
2. External analysis of the industry and its competitive environment
Resources can lead to a competitive advantage:
- If they are valuable, rare, hard to duplicate
- If tangible resources, intangible resource, and org capabilities are combined
# Firm Resources
## Tangible Firm Resources
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Tangible resources</mark> are assets that are relatively easy to identify
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Physical assets</mark>: plant and facilities, location, machinery and equipment

- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Technological resources</mark>: data analytic algots, patents, copyrights, TMs
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Organizational resources</mark>: effective planning processes, evaluation and control systems
## Intangible Firm Resources
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Intangible resources</mark>: difficult for competitors to account for or imitate, embedded in unique routines and practices
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Human resources</mark>: trust, experience and capabilities of employees; managerial skills, firm specific practices and procedures
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Innovation resources</mark>: tech and scientific expertise, ideas, and innovation capabilities

2. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Rare</mark> or uncommon; difficult to exploit
3. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Difficult to imitate</mark> or copy due to physical uniqueness, path dependency, casual ambiguity, or social complexity
4. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Difficult to substitute</mark> with strategically equivalent resources or capabilities
### Sources of Inimitability
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Physical uniqueness</mark>: Resources that are physically unique, therefore impossible to duplicate
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Path dependency</mark>: hard to duplicate because of all that has happened along the path followed in the dev and/or accumulation of resources
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Causal ambiguity</mark>: impossible to explain what caused a resource to exist or how to re-create it
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Social complexity</mark>: resources that result from social engineering such as interpersonal relations
### The generation and distribution of the Firm's Profits
4 factors that help explain the extent to which employees and managers may be able to obtain a much higher level of profits that they generate
