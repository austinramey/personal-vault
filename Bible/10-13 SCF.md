Passage: #Luke
> [!bible]+ [Luke 20:27-40 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/42/20/)
>  <sup> 27 </sup>There came to him some Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection, <sup> 28 </sup>and they asked him a question, saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man  must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. <sup> 29 </sup>Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without children. <sup> 30 </sup>And the second <sup> 31 </sup>and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died. <sup> 32 </sup>Afterward the woman also died. <sup> 33 </sup>In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife.” <sup> 34 </sup>And Jesus said to them,  “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, <sup> 35 </sup>but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage, <sup> 36 </sup>for they cannot die anymore, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons  of the resurrection. <sup> 37 </sup>But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. <sup> 38 </sup>Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him.” <sup> 39 </sup>Then some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, you have spoken well.” <sup> 40 </sup>For they no longer dared to ask him any question.

>  <sup> 1 </sup>My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you, <sup> 2 </sup>making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding; <sup> 3 </sup>yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding, <sup> 4 </sup>if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures, <sup> 5 </sup>then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God. <sup> 6 </sup>For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding; <sup> 7 </sup>he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity, <sup> 8 </sup>guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints. <sup> 9 </sup>Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path; <sup> 10 </sup>for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;
