Passage
> [!bible]+ [Galatians 4:4-7 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/48/4/)
>  <sup> 4 </sup>But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, <sup> 5 </sup>to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. <sup> 6 </sup>And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!” <sup> 7 </sup>So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God.
