Takeaway: At advent, we celebrate the Shepard who secured our salvation

Passage
> [!bible]+ [Micah 5:1-5 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/33/5/)
>  <sup> 1 </sup>Now muster your troops, O daughter  of troops; siege is laid against us; with a rod they strike the judge of Israel on the cheek. <sup> 2 </sup>But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days. <sup> 3 </sup>Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has given birth; then the rest of his brothers shall return to the people of Israel. <sup> 4 </sup>And he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God. And they shall dwell secure, for now he shall be great to the ends of the earth. <sup> 5 </sup>And he shall be their peace.  When the Assyrian comes into our land and treads in our palaces, then we will raise against him seven shepherds and eight princes of men;

> [!bible]+ [John 10:11-15 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/43/10/)
>  <sup> 11 </sup>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. <sup> 12 </sup>He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. <sup> 13 </sup>He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. <sup> 14 </sup>I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, <sup> 15 </sup>just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.

Structure:
- There is no time for a Shepherd
- This Shepherd will be unlike any other Shepherd 

# This is no Time for a Shepherd
- A rancher leads from the front, a Shepherd leads from the rear
- The book of Micah is written during a time of turmoil and fear

> [!bible]+ [Micah 1:6-7 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/33/1/)
>  <sup> 6 </sup>Therefore I will make Samaria a heap in the open country, a place for planting vineyards, and I will pour down her stones into the valley and uncover her foundations. <sup> 7 </sup>All her carved images shall be beaten to pieces, all her wages shall be burned with fire, and all her idols I will lay waste, for from the fee of a prostitute she gathered them, and to the fee of a prostitute they shall return.

God gave an assurance of judgement
> [!bible]+ [Micah 2:3-5 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/33/2/)
>  <sup> 3 </sup>Therefore thus says the LORD: behold, against this family I am devising disaster,  from which you cannot remove your necks, and you shall not walk haughtily, for it will be a time of disaster. <sup> 4 </sup>In that day they shall take up a taunt song against you and moan bitterly, and say, “We are utterly ruined; he changes the portion of my people; how he removes it from me! To an apostate he allots our fields.” <sup> 5 </sup>Therefore you will have none to cast the line by lot in the assembly of the LORD.

God still makes an avenue of escape
> [!bible]+ [Micah 5:1-3 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/33/5/)
>  <sup> 1 </sup>Now muster your troops, O daughter  of troops; siege is laid against us; with a rod they strike the judge of Israel on the cheek. <sup> 2 </sup>But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days. <sup> 3 </sup>Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has given birth; then the rest of his brothers shall return to the people of Israel.

Even though there is judgement, he is giving salvation, but it is not coming yet

It is coming from an unknown source, that most would cast aside

What do we know about Bethlehem?
- Smallest and most insignificant of villages
- Best known because of Rachel, Ruth, and David
	- Rachel was buried near Ephraim, mentioned twice, and the wife that Jacob loved
	- End of Ruth, mentioned as where Ruth's kids are born, as Obed, and eventually grandfather of David

Two unlikely sources of Judah's deliverance:
- First is the insignificant village
- Second is the insignificant shepherd
- Is this is promise or a letdown to people who are in despair?

God's promise of deliverance is a picture of the Gospel
- This is how God brings his promises about

God judges unfaithfulness. He demands perfection. But even after he has announced his judgement, he makes a way of escape

God demands perfection
> [!bible]+ [Matthew 5:48 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/40/5/)
>  <sup> 48 </sup>You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

Jesus is our perfection
> [!bible]+ [Hebrews 4:15 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/58/4/)
>  <sup> 15 </sup>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.

# This shepherd will be unlike any other Shepherd
> [!bible]+ [Micah 5:4-5 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/33/5/)
>  <sup> 4 </sup>And he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God. And they shall dwell secure, for now he shall be great to the ends of the earth. <sup> 5 </sup>And he shall be their peace.  When the Assyrian comes into our land and treads in our palaces, then we will raise against him seven shepherds and eight princes of men;

This shepherd will be greater than Davis

He will shepherd God's flock in the strength of the Lord. His first priority will be God rather than Judah
> [!bible]+ [Micah 5:2 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/33/5/)
>  <sup> 2 </sup>But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.
