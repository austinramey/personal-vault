Prayer: #revelation
> [!bible]+ [Revelation 21:1-8 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/66/21/)
>  <sup> 1 </sup>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. <sup> 2 </sup>And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. <sup> 3 </sup>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place  of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people,  and God himself will be with them as their God. <sup> 4 </sup>He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.” <sup> 5 </sup>And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.” <sup> 6 </sup>And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment. <sup> 7 </sup>The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and he will be my son. <sup> 8 </sup>But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”

>  <sup> 41 </sup>But he said to them, “How can they say that the Christ is David's son? <sup> 42 </sup>For David himself says in the Book of Psalms,  “‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, <sup> 43 </sup>until I make your enemies your footstool.”’ <sup> 44 </sup>David thus calls him Lord, so how is he his son?” <sup> 45 </sup>And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples, <sup> 46 </sup>“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, <sup> 47 </sup>who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”
