Passage: #Luke

> [!bible]+ [Luke 20:20-26 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/42/20/)
>  <sup> 20 </sup>So they watched him and sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might catch him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor. <sup> 21 </sup>So they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and show no partiality,  but truly teach the way of God. <sup> 22 </sup>Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?” <sup> 23 </sup>But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, <sup> 24 </sup>“Show me a denarius.  Whose likeness and inscription does it have?” They said, “Caesar's.” <sup> 25 </sup>He said to them, “Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” <sup> 26 </sup>And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him in what he said, but marveling at his answer they became silent.

Prayer: #Romans
> [!bible]+ [Romans 6:1-4 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/45/6/)
>  <sup> 1 </sup>What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? <sup> 2 </sup>By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? <sup> 3 </sup>Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? <sup> 4 </sup>We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.
