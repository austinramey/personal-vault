Title: Two Kingdoms?
Passage: #Luke

> [!bible]+ [Luke 20:20-26 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/42/20/)
>  <sup> 20 </sup>So they watched him and sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might catch him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor. <sup> 21 </sup>So they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and show no partiality,  but truly teach the way of God. <sup> 22 </sup>Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?” <sup> 23 </sup>But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, <sup> 24 </sup>“Show me a denarius.  Whose likeness and inscription does it have?” They said, “Caesar's.” <sup> 25 </sup>He said to them, “Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” <sup> 26 </sup>And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him in what he said, but marveling at his answer they became silent.

Prayer: #Romans
> [!bible]+ [Romans 6:1-4 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/45/6/)
>  <sup> 1 </sup>What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? <sup> 2 </sup>By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it? <sup> 3 </sup>Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? <sup> 4 </sup>We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.

Outline:
- The hypocrisy of the spies v20
- The real of the tricky question v21-22
- The surprising answer v23-25
- Response of the spies v26

"We honor ceaser and God, knowing that one kingdom is eternal and the other is not"

# The hypocrisy 20:20
> [!bible]+ [Luke 20:20 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/42/20/)
>  <sup> 20 </sup>So they watched him and sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might catch him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor.

- The spies are actors playing a role, not being sincere
- To "watch closely" is to watch with evil intentions - Daniel 6
- These spies had to play a role as if in a play

# The Trap: 21-22
> [!bible]+ [Luke 20:21-22 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/42/20/)
>  <sup> 21 </sup>So they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and show no partiality,  but truly teach the way of God. <sup> 22 </sup>Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?”

- The spies used the right term in calling him Jesus
	- But they called him that with false respect
- "Liar, Lunatic, or Lord" - C.S. Lewis
	- Either he is the son of God, or he is a lunatic
- Only accept or reject Christ, no middle of the line
- Are they trying to appeal to his vanity?
- The "Way" Is proper Jewish theology, and a term used to describe Christians
> [!bible]+ [Acts 9:2 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/44/9/)
>  <sup> 2 </sup>and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

> [!bible]+ [Acts 19:9 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/44/19/)
>  <sup> 9 </sup>But when some became stubborn and continued in unbelief, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus.

- The term "lawful" implies movement
> [!bible]+ [Matthew 15:11 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/40/15/)
>  <sup> 11 </sup>it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.”

- The idea of paying tribute to a foreign ruler is particularly troublesome to the Jew
	- Paid directly to Rome, it is seen as very hurtful to keep paying the upkeep of the subjugation from Rome
# The Answer: v23-25
> [!bible]+ [Luke 20:23-25 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/42/20/)
>  <sup> 23 </sup>But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, <sup> 24 </sup>“Show me a denarius.  Whose likeness and inscription does it have?” They said, “Caesar's.” <sup> 25 </sup>He said to them, “Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.”

- Whose likeness is on the denarius?
	- Ceaser on one side, his mother on the other
- The key to understanding 20:25 is found in 20:24
	- "Likeness and inscription"
- All humans are made in the "image and like was of God"
> [!bible]+ [Genesis 1:26-27 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/1/1/)
>  <sup> 26 </sup>Then God said, “Let us make man  in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” <sup> 27 </sup>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.

- We are the coin, we are in the likeness of God
# The Response: 26
> [!bible]+ [Luke 20:26 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/42/20/)
>  <sup> 26 </sup>And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him in what he said, but marveling at his answer they became silent.

- Once again, an attempt to trap Jesus has only embarrassed those who pursue him
- The keep trying to trap him in public, but they keep failing
# Applications
## Respect the two-kingdom approach
- Govt. has a right to exist.
- Understand difference between God's Authority, and the delegated authority of the state
- While both exist, they are not at
