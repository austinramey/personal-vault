Title: The Trinity in Advent
Passage
> [!bible]+ [Galatians 4:4-7 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/48/4/)
>  <sup> 4 </sup>But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, <sup> 5 </sup>to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. <sup> 6 </sup>And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!” <sup> 7 </sup>So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God.

> [!bible]+ [Galatians 3:23-29 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/48/3/)
>  <sup> 23 </sup>Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. <sup> 24 </sup>So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. <sup> 25 </sup>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, <sup> 26 </sup>for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. <sup> 27 </sup>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. <sup> 28 </sup>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave  nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <sup> 29 </sup>And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.

# God sent His Son - 4:4

Jesus always give an overflowing amount

NT uses two terms for time:
- Chronos (chronological time)
- Kairos (special time)

Which one does he use here? Why?
- Used Chronos
- Not sure why, but could have been that no one knew when Christ was coming, after the time in which He was prophesied, and 400 years after Malachi and time without God speaking

"God sent his Son" - the most concise summary of the Gospel

Jesus was born as any other baby has been born

Jesus was born into a particular set of circumstances
# Jesus redeemed his people - 4:5
> [!bible]+ [Galatians 4:5 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/48/4/)
>  <sup> 5 </sup>to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.

To redeem something is to repurchase it, usually at significant cost
> [!bible]+ [Galatians 3:13 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/48/3/)
>  <sup> 13 </sup>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us — for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree” —

Adoption is a joyous event

Adoption is a solemn event
