Prayer
> [!bible]+ [Romans 1:1-15 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/45/1/)
>  <sup> 1 </sup>Paul, a servant  of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, <sup> 2 </sup>which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, <sup> 3 </sup>concerning his Son, who was descended from David  according to the flesh <sup> 4 </sup>and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, <sup> 5 </sup>through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations, <sup> 6 </sup>including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ, <sup> 7 </sup>To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <sup> 8 </sup>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world. <sup> 9 </sup>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you <sup> 10 </sup>always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you. <sup> 11 </sup>For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you — <sup> 12 </sup>that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine. <sup> 13 </sup>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers,  that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles. <sup> 14 </sup>I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians,  both to the wise and to the foolish. <sup> 15 </sup>So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
