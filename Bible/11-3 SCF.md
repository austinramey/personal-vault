Title: The Heart of the (Money) Matter
Verse:
> [!bible]+ [Luke 21:1-4 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/42/21/)
>  <sup> 1 </sup>Jesus  looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box, <sup> 2 </sup>and he saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins. <sup> 3 </sup>And he said, “Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them. <sup> 4 </sup>For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.”

Prayer
> [!bible]+ [1 Timothy 6:1-10 - ESV](https://bolls.life/ESV/54/6/)
>  <sup> 1 </sup>Let all who are under a yoke as bondservants  regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be reviled. <sup> 2 </sup>Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful on the ground that they are brothers; rather they must serve all the better since those who benefit by their good service are believers and beloved. <b>False Teachers and True Contentment</b>  Teach and urge these things. <sup> 3 </sup>If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound  words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness, <sup> 4 </sup>he is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions, <sup> 5 </sup>and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. <sup> 6 </sup>But godliness with contentment is great gain, <sup> 7 </sup>for we brought nothing into the world, and  we cannot take anything out of the world. <sup> 8 </sup>But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content. <sup> 9 </sup>But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. <sup> 10 </sup>For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.


Overview:
1. Set the scene
2. People of the scene
3. Contrast that is provided
4. What do we need to do?

Big Idea:
God values the quality of our heart more than the quantity of our offering 

# Context/Intro
Will your supervisor care about your motivation?
- Not really, moreso the task getting it done 
- God does not feel that way
- God wants our heart, not our stuff

Jesus has returned to Jerusalem, and has been challenged, and victorious multiple times
Could have been right after 20 ending
Focused on what God truly cares about
Not focused on the money, but the faith

# The Scene
## The temple
Rich and poor would regularly give their offering in the Treasury
Many different offerings would be provided at different times of the year
Some would even announce the amount that was put in
## The money
She gave 2 lepta, which was worth 2/128 of a day's wages
About 1.28 in today's money

# The People
## The Widow
In a uniquely hard situation
