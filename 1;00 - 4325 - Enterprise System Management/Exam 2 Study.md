# Chapter 5
## Tool: The Convergent Experimental Method
1. Define the Question and Its Variables
	- Question statement
		- Independent variable (or cause)
		- Dependent variable (or effect)
1. Pick your testers
2. Randomize your test and control
3. Validate your sample
	- Unit of analysis
	- n = ? (sample size)
	- Signal-to-noise ratio
4. Test and analyze
5. Decide
6. Share learning
- Useful for 
	- Innovating on existing products
	- Optimizing and continually improving them
	- Comparing versions in the later stages of an innovation process
## Tool: Divergent Experimental Method
1st Stage
1. Define the problem
2. Set limits
	- Time limit
	- Money limit
	- Scope limit
1. Pick your people
2nd Stage: Iteration
4. Observe
5. Generate more than one solution
6. Build an MVP
7. Field Test
	- Customer value assumptions
	- Business model assumptions
8. Decide
	- Proceed
	- Pivot
	- Prepare to launch
	- Pull the plug
3rd Stage: Action
9. Scale up
10. Share learning
- Particularly useful for
	- Innovations that are less defined from the outself
	- Highly iterative
	- May span weeks or months
- Has 3 stages
	- Preparation
	- Iteration
	- Action
## Innovation
Any change to a business product, service or process that adds value
- The process by which new business ideas are developed, tested, and brought to the market
## Innovating Differently
How to grow the Innovation Premium:
- Enterprises need to innovate in a radically different fashion, based on rapid experimentation and continuous learning
- Moving from decisions and ideas that are slow and expensive, to cheaper and faster ideas and decisions, as well as learning from failures
## Experimentation is Learning
An iterative process of learning what does or does not work
- Goal is not a product or solution
- Goal is learning about customers, markets, etc
- ==Rapid experimentation==: transforming the way innovation happens
## Convergent Experiments
- It is critical for establishing 'causal' as opposed to 'correlation' relationships
- Focused on finding causal examples, such as if I add this, it will increase customers on my site
## Divergent Experiments
- Process is more informal than convergent
- Provides qualitiatve feedback
	- It was confusing
	- I would use this if others were using it
## Why you need both
- Both are needed for different parts of the business
- To balance exploratory learning and confirmatory learning
- Convergent for improving existing businesses
- Divergent for developing new business areas
## How Digital is Impacting both
- Offering new tools for experimentation
- Increasing speed at which innovation must happen
- Convergent
	- New software
	- Increasing focus on data analytics
	- Ubiquity with mobile computing and IoT
- Divergent
	- New ways to prototype ideas
	- Newer programming lanaguages
	- Robots taking over manual tasks
## 7 Principles of Experimentation
- Learn early
- Be fast and iterate
- Fall in love with the problem, not the solution
- Get credible feedback
- Measure what matters now
- Test your assumptions
- Fail smart
### Learn Early
- Traditional innovation cycle: 
	- Observe, generate ideas, Analyze and discuss, team decision, design product, build product, launch and market, customer response
- Innovation by rapid experimentation
	- Observe, generate ideas, design prototype and test, customer response
## Four Paths to Scaling Up an Innovation
Answer these two questions will place you in one of four quadrants
- Can iterate quickly after launch/Can limit roll-out => MVP roll-out
	- First path for scaling up an innovation
	- Easiest path for introducing an innovation
	- Iterate and learn with real customers without much public scrutiny
- Can iterate quickly after launch/Cannot limit roll-out => MVP launch
	- Second path for scaling up an innovation
	- Business is forced to iterate very quickly after launch
	- Business has to rely on network effects
## Org. Challenges of Innovation
- Traditionally, Highest Paid Person Opinion made all the decisions
- Today, rethinking innovation requires sig. org. changes, beginning with how decisions are made
	- Building a Test-and-Learn culture
	- Leading without deciding
	- Involving Everyone
	- Planning to fail and celebrating it
# Chapter 6 - Adapt Value Proposition
## Rethinking Value: What Business Are You In?
- How businesses adapt their value Proposition
- Why every business should adapt before it needs to
- How many businesses fail?
- Org barriers prevent business from adapting how it serves customers
- Traditionally, value prop was treated as a constant, and a source of competitive advantage for the long haul
	- In digital age, focus on the same value prop is not longer sufficient
- Constantly exame core value and ask:
	- Why does the business exist?
	- What needs does it serves?
	- What Business am I really in?
### Changes from Analog to Digital

| FROM                                        | TO                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Val. Prop. Defined by industry              | Defined by customer needs                         |
| Execute current Val. Prop                   | Uncover next opportunity for customer value       |
| Optimize bus. Model as long as possible     | Evolve before you must to stay ahead of the curve |
| View change by how it impacts you right now | View change by how it could create more business  |
| Market success allows for complacency       | Only the paranoid survive                         |

## Three Routes Out of a Shrinking Market Position
### New Customers
- Find new customers to buy your same offering
	- Could be difficult
### New Value
- Serve the same customer but adapt to stay relevant
### New Value + New Customers
- When a dramatic shift succeeds in capturing a new market of customers
## Adopt Before You Must
- No need to wait for a crisis in the company
	- Look ahead to shifts in customer needs
	- Preparing to ender new markets with new value props

## Five Concepts of Market Value
1. Product
	- Essential: most overused strategic lens
2. Customer
	- Helps identify who to focus on, but fails to focus on value delivered
3. Use case
	- Context in which customer uses the product or service
	- Can lead to better customer segmentation
4. Job to be done
	- Focuses on underlying problem the customer is trying to solve
		- Considers both the context in and purpose for use of the product
5. Value proposition
	- Benefits received by a customer from what a company is offering
		- Both value-centric and customer centric
		- More concrete, more specific

## Value Proposition Road map
- Used to assess and adapt value prop for customers and to identify
	- New and emerging threats
	- New opportunities that create customer value
- Helps challenge assumptions
1. Identify key customer types by value received
2. Define current value for each customer
3. Identify emerging threats
4. Assess strength of current value elements
5. Generate new potential value elements
6. Synthesize new value prop
## Org Challenges
- Dedicate leadership of who will be in charge of change
- Move talent and money to new ventures
- Avoid nearsightedness
# Chapter 7 - Disruptive Business Models
## Disruption Defined
- Happens when an existing industry faces a challenger that offers more value to customers than what existing firms did
	- Existing firms cannot compete directly with them
## In the Digital Age
- Digital tech enables the rewriting of the rules of business
- New rules allow opportunities for new challengers to take on older, more profitable businesses
## Theories
1. Create destruction
	- Process where capitalism inherently destroys old industries and economic systems
2. Disruptive Innovation
	- Disrupter starts out selling to buyers in a new market
	- Disrupter offers an innovative, cheaper, or more accessible product
		- Typically worse performance and features
	- Existing companies ignore the challenger since it does not target its own customers
	- Eventually, innovative product gets good enough to become a viable alternative to the existing company
## Business Model of Disruption
- Assumption: Best lens thorugh which to view disruption is business models
	- Current disrupters are applying established tech to the design of new business models
- Definition: wholistic view of how a business creates value, delivers it to the market, and captures value in return
- Components (Johnson, Christensen and Kagermann):
	- Customer value proposition
	- Profit formula
	- Key resources
	- Key processes
- Components (Osterwalder and Pigneur)
	- Customer segments
	- Value props
	- Channels
	- Customer relationships
	- Revenue streams
	- Key resources
	- Key activities
	- Key partnerships
	- Cost structure
- Two sides of a business model
	1. Value proposition - value that a business offers to the customer
	2. Value network - people, partners, assets and processes that enable a business to earn value from value proposition
- To disrupt a business, challengers must:
	- Have a difference in value proposition that displaces value provided from existing business
	- Difference in value network that creates a barrier to imitation
### Value Proposition Differential
- Disrupters require a difference in value prop that can come from
	- Price
	- Free/Fremium offers
	- Access
	- Simplicity
	- Personalization
	- Aggregation
	- Unbundling
	- Integration
	- Social
### Value Network Differential
- Disrupters require a difference in value network that is hard to imitate, from:
	- Customers
	- Channels
	- Partners
	- Networks
	- Complementary products/services
	- Brand
	- Revenue model
	- Cost structure
	- Skills and processes
	- Physical assets
	- IP assets
	- Data assets
## Variables in BMDT
### Customer Trajectory
Focused on which customers will provide the initial basis for challenger's market entry
- Can enter through one of two trajectories
	- Outside-in: selling to buyers that are not currently served by incumbent
	- Inside-out: selling to some sub-segment of current customers
### Disruptive Scope
- In many cases the scope is not 100 percent:
	- After being disrupted, incumbent's product/business model hangs on, confined to a smaller portion of the market
- Predicting disruptive scope
	- Use cases - Some customers will prefer the new product, and some will continue with the old
	- Customer segments - New value prop is preferable to only some segments
	- Network effects - Network effects can play an important role in determining scope of disruption
### Multiple Incumbents
- Different industries or classes of companies are challenged by the same new disruptive business model
## Disruptive Business Model Map
- Purpose: Asses whehter or not a new challenger poses a disruptive threat to an incumbent industry/business
1. Challenger
	- Analyze challenger: what is the disruptive business
		- What is unique about it
2. Incumbent
	- Who is the incumbent and is there more than one?
3. Customer
	- Who is the target customer? Is there more than one type?
4. Value Proposition
	- What is the value offered by the challenger to the target customer?
5. Value Proposition Differential
	- How does the challenger's value prop differ?
6. Value Network
	- What enables the challenger to create, deliver and earn value from its offering
7. Value Network Differential
	- What sets them apart in this?
8. Two-Part Test
	- 1st Question: Does the challenger's value prop displace the value prop?
	- 2nd Question: Do any of the differences in value networks create a barrier to prevent imitation?
## Disruptive Response Planner
- Used when you have determined that you are looking at a disruptive challenger
- Purpose: Designed to help map out how a disrupti
