## Tool: The Convergent Experimental Method
1. Define the Question and Its Variables
	- Question statement
		- Independent variable (or cause)
		- Dependent variable (or effect)
1. Pick your testers
2. Randomize your test and control
3. Validate your sample
	- Unit of analysis
	- n = ? (sample size)
	- Signal-to-noise ratio
4. Test and analyze
5. Decide
6. Share learning
- Useful for 
	- Innovating on existing products
	- Optimizing and continually improving them
	- Comparing versions in the later stages of an innovation process
## Tool: Divergent Experimental Method
1st Stage
1. Define the problem
2. Set limits
	- Time limit
	- Money limit
	- Scope limit
1. Pick your people
2nd Stage: Iteration
4. Observe
5. Generate more than one solution
6. Build an MVP
7. Field Test
	- Customer value assumptions
	- Business model assumptions
8. Decide
	- Proceed
	- Pivot
	- Prepare to launch
	- Pull the plug
3rd Stage: Action
9. Scale up
10. Share learning
- Particularly useful for
	- Innovations that are less defined from the outself
	- Highly iterative
	- May span weeks or months
- Has 3 stages
	- Preparation
	- Iteration
	- Action
## Innovation
Any change to a business product, service or process that adds value
- The process by which new business ideas are developed, tested, and brought to the market
## Innovating Differently
How to grow the Innovation Premium:
- Enterprises need to innovate in a radically different fashion, based on rapid experimentation and continuous learning
- Moving from decisions and ideas that are slow and expensive, to cheaper and faster ideas and decisions, as well as learning from failures
## Experimentation is Learning
An iterative process of learning what does or does not work
- Goal is not a product or solution
- Goal is learning about customers, markets, etc
- ==Rapid experimentation==: transforming the way innovation happens
## Convergent Experiments
- It is critical for establishing 'causal' as opposed to 'correlation' relationships
- Focused on finding causal examples, such as if I add this, it will increase customers on my site
## Divergent Experiments
- Process is more informal than convergent
- Provides qualitiatve feedback
	- It was confusing
	- I would use this if others were using it
## Why you need both
- Both are needed for different parts of the business
- To balance exploratory learning and confirmatory learning
- Convergent for improving existing businesses
- Divergent for developing new business areas
## How Digital is Impacting both
- Offering new tools for experimentation
- Increasing speed at which innovation must happen
- Convergent
	- New software
	- Increasing focus on data analytics
	- Ubiquity with mobile computing and IoT
- Divergent
	- New ways to prototype ideas
	- Newer programming lanaguages
	- Robots taking over manual tasks
## 7 Principles of Experimentation
- Learn early
- Be fast and iterate
- Fall in love with the problem, not the solution
- Get credible feedback
- Measure what matters now
- Test your assumptions
- Fail smart
### Learn Early
- Traditional innovation cycle: 
	- Observe, generate ideas, Analyze and discuss, team decision, design product, build product, launch and market, customer response
- Innovation by rapid experimentation
	- Observe, generate ideas, design prototype and test, customer response
## Four Paths to Scaling Up an Innovation
Answer these two questions will place you in one of four quadrants
- Can iterate quickly after launch/Can limit roll-out => MVP roll-out
	- First path for scaling up an innovation
	- Easiest path for introducing an innovation
	- Iterate and learn with real customers without much public scrutiny
- Can iterate quickly after launch/Cannot limit roll-out => MVP launch
	- Second path for scaling up an innovation
	- Business is forced to iterate very quickly after launch
	- Business has to rely on network effects
## Org. Challenges of Innovation
- Traditionally, Highest Paid Person Opinion made all the decisions
- Today, rethinking innovation requires sig. org. changes, beginning with how decisions are made
	- Building a Test-and-Learn culture
	- Leading without deciding
	- Involving Everyone
	- Planning
