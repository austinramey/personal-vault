## Innovation
Any change to a business product, service or process that adds value
- The process by which new business ideas are developed, tested, and brought to the market
## Innovating Differently
How to grow the Innovation Premium:
- Enterprises need to innovate in a radically different fashion, based on rapid experimentation and continuous learning
- Moving from decisions and ideas that are slow and expensive, to cheaper and faster ideas and decisions, as well as learning from failures
## Experimentation is Learning
An iterative process of learning what does or does not work
- Goal is not a product or solution
- Goal is learning about customers, markets, etc
- ==Rapid experimentation==: transforming the way innovation happens
## Convergent Experiments
- It is critical for establishing 'causal' as opposed to 'correlation' relationships
- Focused on finding causal examples, such as if I add this, it will increase customers on my site
## Divergent Experiments
- Process is more informal than convergent
- Provides qualitiatve feedback
	- It was confusing
	- I would use this if others were using it
## Why you need both
- Both are needed for different parts of the business
- To balance exploratory learning and confirmatory learning
- Convergent for improving existing businesses
- Divergent for developing new business areas
